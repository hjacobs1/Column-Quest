# Column-Quest
Column Quest is an iOS application that uses image recognition to determine the type of column, Corinthian, Doric, or Ionic, in a given image. The user can take a picture of the column for the app to identify or load one in from their photo library. The app compresses the selected image, converts it grayscale, turns it into a matrix with elements represnting its pixel values, then uses matrix operations to compare the input image to an internal library of columns classified by their type, ultimately determining which set of images the input is most similar to.

Thank you to the makers of the Swift libraries EasyImagy and MathSwift!

This project was created during the 5C Hackathon hosted by Pomona College, in which it placed second in the beginner category.

This was our first time coding in Swift! We learned a lot during development and had a ton of fun.
